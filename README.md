Podcast recording app.
The concept here is to be able to send a guest
a link and intervew them using their android or ios Phone

The recording is only done on the inviter's side,
and is mixed so that they are on the left and the interviewee
is on the right,

All done with webaudio - no server needed - except
|pipe|'s rendezvous server.

Based on some work I did for family systems, but with their
special source removed!
