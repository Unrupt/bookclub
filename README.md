# Bookclub - a remote bookclub app.

# THIS IS A WISH LIST - THIS APP DOES NONE OF THESE THINGS _YET_

## Features
1) Simple - send a link your members, they open it on their smartphone
2) Everyone hears everyone else - spread in a stereo space.
3) FREE + opensource
4) Audio quality is better than PSTN, skype, Zoom etc 
5) All done in the browser no app to download or install for your guest - or you

### NOTE - This is BETA quality software, it might break, lose your recordings, frighten your cat etc...

## Requirements
### Host needs to use Chrome (on a laptop or Android).
### The host needs more compute resources than the members (TBD)
### The guest can use Safari on iOS or Chrome on Android

## How to use it as a Host

1) Make a an appointment with the guest.
2) Just before the interview, browse to https://pipe.github.io/bookcclub/ 
this creates a link, 
3) share the link with your members 
you can use email, twitter DMs , SMS whatever works for you and your members
4) Click 'Done' - allow Microphone use and wait for the members to join.
5) Each member opens the link, accepts the call and enables the microphone use.
(you must click 'Done' before the guest 'Accepts')
6) Talk about the book.

7) At the end of the call click the square button.

## Sample note I send to a new Member:
You'll need to have read the book - and....
1) a quiet room
2) a smartphone
3) decent internet

Just before the session I'll send you a link.
When you get it please open it on your Smartphone. Click 'Accept' to take the call and agree to the dropdown to 
asking for access your microphone, place the phone somewhere comfortable, adjust the speaker volume and just talk. (The mic symbol mutes/unmutes your microphone, the square ends the call). You can use earbuds/headset/airpods if you like.


Enjoy!
